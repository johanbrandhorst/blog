I'm Johan, I've been doing open source since 2016, mostly in the Go ecosystem 🐻. I'm currently a maintainer 👨‍🔧 of:

- [**The gRPC-Gateway**](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway) 🌉, a HTTP/JSON <-> gRPC translation layer which is serving companies and open source projects such as [etcd](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/dev-guide/api_grpc_gateway.md), [Core OS](https://coreos.com/blog/grpc-protobufs-swagger.html), [Cockroach DB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/), [Chef](https://www.chef.io/) and others.
- [**Go gRPC Middleware**](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware) 🥪, a collection of interceptors that add logging, metrics, tracing, authentication, retrying logic and more to your Go gRPC servers.

I'm also a contributor 👨‍💻 to:

- [**The Go standard library**](https://github.com/golang/go), especially the WebAssembly port, where I led the implementation of the WASI preview 1 port (`wasip1`) and related functionality such as `go:wasmimport`, `go:wasmexport` and more.

I frequently deliver technical talks 🗨️ at conferences, including [**GopherCon San Diego** 🇺🇸](https://www.gophercon.com), [**GopherCon UK** 🇬🇧](https://www.gophercon.co.uk), [**dotGo** 🇫🇷](https://www.dotgo.eu), [**GopherCon EU** 🇪🇺](https://gophercon.berlin/), [**FOSDEM** 🇧🇪](https://fosdem.org) and more. I've also featured on [**Go Time** 🎙️](https://changelog.com/gotime) on topics ranging from security 🛡️ to PostgreSQL 🐘.

Lastly, I'm frequently helping 👨‍🏫 beginners and experienced users alike to solve problems with their code and setup on Gophers slack, in particular on the topics that I have specific expertise, such as gRPC, protobuf and security. I can be found in the Gophers Slack under the username `jbrandhorst`. Come say hi!
