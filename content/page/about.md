I'm Johan, I like gaming, programming, floorball, skiing and many other things.
I'm originally from Sweden but I live and work in the United Kingdom.
I work at [InfoSum](https://www.infosum.com/), a data startup in
Basingstoke, UK.

My (current!) favourite programming languages are Go and Python. I also
have a great interest in learning Rust and Elm.

You can find me on the [Gophers Slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/)
under the id `jbrandhorst`, where I like
to hang around and discuss Go with fellow Gophers.
