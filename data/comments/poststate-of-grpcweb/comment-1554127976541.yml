  gRPC over websockets is possible with a properly instrumented server, see
  https://github.com/dennwc/dom/tree/master/examples/grpc-over-ws for an example
  implementation of this (using Go and webassembly). However, this is
  problematic since it means implementing TCP over websockets over TCP, a huge
  inefficiency. The gRPC-Web spec tries to make the best gRPC-equivalent
  transport possible from the browser. When we get websockets over HTTP/2 in the
  browser the spec may be expanded to include this as a possible transport, but
  today it is pretty pointless.
