  There are benefits to be sure, but this is so far removed from the rest of the
  existing web ecosystem as to be mostly academic in importance I think. You can
  do it today in your own stack if you want to, but you'll end up with huge
  webassembly binaries (because now the client needs the whole http2-over-tcp
  stack compiled in) and a Go gRPC server that can't talk to normal gRPC
  servers. It's certainly exciting as a tech demo, but for wider adoption I
  think the route that the gRPC-Web team has adopted with the spec is the right
  one.
