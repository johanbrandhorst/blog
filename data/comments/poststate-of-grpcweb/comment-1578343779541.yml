comment: "Some advice would be really helpful as I am a beginner on using grpc. I am building a client application that talks to the grpc server to retrieve data packets to render shapes(rectangle, circle) on the canvas. I also need to send data back if the user draws any shapes on the canvas.\r\nI was thinking of doing over websockets as well but looks like a bit inefficient.\r\nSo my question is do I have any option other than using the grpc-web and grpc-web proxy as of today?"
