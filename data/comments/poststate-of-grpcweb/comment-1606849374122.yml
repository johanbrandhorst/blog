  Thanks for this informative writeup. Were you able to build a working demo of
  the JavaScript client? I managed to get the Quick Start demo working:
  https://grpc.io/docs/platforms/web/quickstart/. But when I tried to modify the
  JavaScript client to talk to my own gRPC server (Python), I hit a wall. More
  info here: https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web/issues/1001
