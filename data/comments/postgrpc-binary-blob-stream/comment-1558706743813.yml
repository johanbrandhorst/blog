comment: "Hi Divyanshu,\r\n\r\n`bytes` can be used for this, sure, and streaming is ideal in the case of large data transfers. If you're working with a large structure in Go, you can use the `gob` package to serialize it to `bytes`. If you're working with an existing protobuf structure, you can use `proto.Marshal()` to marshal it into `bytes` as well. Note that `[]byte` in Go can be converted to `string` as well. Not sure what that has to do with memory inefficiency though since it's the same underlying representation in memory."
