comment: "Hi Johan,\r\n\r\nWould you think using `bytes` for sending large arbitrary structures through gRPC could be possible? I want to send a large structure through gRPC as a payload. However, I don't understand how to pack this structure into the `bytes` format required by protobuf. In C++, `bytes` is implemented in the form of strings, which is memory inefficient for large data structures.\r\n\r\nThanks"
