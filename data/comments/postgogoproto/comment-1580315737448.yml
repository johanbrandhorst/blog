comment: "Hi Johan, thanks for sharing this!\r\nAnother problem with gRPC Gateway seems to be with `gogoproto.customtype` (kind of UUID in my case).\r\nI have `bytes` field in proto file. Then in generated *.pb.gw.go I have compilation errors because generated code looks like \r\n```\r\nprotoReq.OrderId, err = runtime.Bytes(val)\r\n```\r\nDo you know anything about this?"
