comment: "Hi Johan,\r\nThis is a very good article on how effectively one can expand the use of gRPC error handling. Based on your article i tried to have my own gRPC message being passed using WithDetails() but it always ends up in giving \":any: message type \"\" isn't linked inerror\" error on the client-side.  Doesn't this support custom proto messages?"
