  Thanks for the helpful post. My only question is re. the go_package option.
  Should the go_package really have the slashes in it? I would think it's more
  "Go idiomatic" to have a single package name there and just organize your
  .proto files in a directory structure as desired. I have observed empirically
  that `protoc` outputs Go files in the same directory structure as the input
  files.
