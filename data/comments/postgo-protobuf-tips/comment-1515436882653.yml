  Thank you for the post and having the patience to work through some of the
  finer details. I have been rather disappointed so far with this tooling, the
  complexity of .proto imports and confusing protoc parameter syntax. the system
  seems unintuitive. For instance, i wish there was a way to simply inline
  .proto imports so that i do not have to tell every protoc invocatin where they
  are. that would also simplify life for anyone trying to generate code to
  interface with my proto server
