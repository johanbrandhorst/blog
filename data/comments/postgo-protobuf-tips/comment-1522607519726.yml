comment: "Thank you so much for this. \r\n\r\nI run my go packages in docker containers so I just tend to `package main` the generated protobuf code so I don't have to reference my $GOPATH all the time. The go_package option saved me a lot of time.\r\n\r\nThe Protobuf documentation is super confusing - surprising considering Go would be a common use case internally at Google. Oh well, I guess they would just look at the existing codebase."
