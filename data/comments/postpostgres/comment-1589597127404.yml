  Thanks for the excellent blog, which helped to me transition my Go project
  from MariaDB to PostgreSQL. One question: Near the beginning of the blog, you
  showcase your code to scan a timestampz, but I've just been scanning them
  directly into a time.Time variable and everything seems to be working great so
  far. Can you explain why your code is needed?
